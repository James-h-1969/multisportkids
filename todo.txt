TO DO:

    Front End ########################################




    Back End #########################################  
        - Currently when someone purchases multiple things the backend is not updating
        - Add parent details into the details that go into the camps
        - Day 2 is not working (think it could be a python issue)
        - update SETCOACHTIMES so that it doesnt add a new coach everytime, it just adds onto their current times

    General ##########################################
        - Update the render so that new env variable for FRONT_URL
        - make new property "archived" as a boolean for camps


######## What to update from dev to production  #####
- URL on front end (to right backend)
